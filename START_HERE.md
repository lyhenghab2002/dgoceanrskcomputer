# 🚨 YOUR SITE IS DOWN - START HERE

## What's Wrong?

Your DigitalOcean server at **152.42.227.254** is experiencing **resource exhaustion** - likely running out of RAM or CPU. Even SSH is slow, which means the server is overloaded.

---

## ⚡ IMMEDIATE FIX (Do This NOW)

### Step 1: SSH into your server
```bash
ssh root@152.42.227.254
```

If SSH is very slow, be patient - it might take 30-60 seconds to connect.

### Step 2: Run this emergency command
```bash
sudo pkill -9 python3 && sudo systemctl restart mysql && sleep 5 && sudo systemctl restart gunicorn && sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### Step 3: Add swap memory (CRITICAL if you have < 2GB RAM)
```bash
# Check if you have swap
sudo swapon --show

# If nothing shows, create swap NOW:
sudo fallocate -l 2G /swapfile
sudo chmod 600 /swapfile
sudo mkswap /swapfile
sudo swapon /swapfile
echo '/swapfile none swap sw 0 0' | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab

# Verify swap is active
sudo swapon --show
```

### Step 4: Check if services are running
```bash
sudo systemctl status gunicorn
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

### Step 5: Test your website
Open your browser and visit your website. It should load now.

## 📊 Check Your Server Health

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /root/dgoceanrskcomputer  # or wherever your app is

# Run the health check
bash check_server_health.sh
```

## 🔧 PERMANENT FIX (Do This Next)

### 1. Update Your Code Repository

I've updated several files in your local repository:

- ✅ **Procfile** - Fixed to use correct app instance
- ✅ **config.py** - Added database connection pooling
- ✅ **gunicorn_config.py** - Created optimal Gunicorn settings
- ✅ **emergency_fix.sh** - Automated server recovery
- ✅ **check_server_health.sh** - Server health monitoring

### 2. Deploy Updated Code to Server

```bash
# On your local machine
git add .
git commit -m "Fix server performance issues"
git push origin main

# On your server (via SSH)
cd /root/dgoceanrskcomputer
git pull origin main

# Restart services
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

### 3. Update Gunicorn Service Configuration

```bash
# On your server
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service
```

**Replace the ExecStart line with:**
```ini
ExecStart=/root/dgoceanrskcomputer/venv/bin/gunicorn \
    --config gunicorn_config.py \
    wsgi:application
```

**Then reload:**
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
sudo systemctl status gunicorn
```

## 💰 SERVER SIZE RECOMMENDATION

Check your current RAM:
```bash
free -h
```

**Minimum Requirements:**
- ✅ **2GB RAM** ($12/month) - Recommended minimum
- ✅ **4GB RAM** ($24/month) - Comfortable for your app
- ❌ **1GB RAM** or less - Too small, will keep crashing

**How to Upgrade:**
1. Go to https://cloud.digitalocean.com
2. Click on your droplet
3. Click "Resize"
4. Choose a larger plan
5. Click "Resize"
